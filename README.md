This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily missed, error in VBScript when using the GetObject function to interact with external applications like Microsoft Excel.  The original code lacked explicit error handling, leading to potential silent failures if Excel wasn't running. The solution provides robust error handling and informs the user when the application is unavailable.
